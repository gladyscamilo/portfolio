            A group exhibition commissioned by Feminist Culture House and curated by Gladys Camilo and Paola Jalili.
            They asked:"What would you want to do with your hands, your ears, your nose, your skin?
            What would you like to practice, to learn, to experiment with? What would happen if you,
            for once, had the opportunity to prioritise your artistic processes and your craft?"
            The exhibition showcases works by Natalie Hamada (silk-screen prints),
            Sara Moayed (mixed media and textile installation), Özgü Gündeşlioğlu (ceramic installation),            and Haliz Yosef (video installation).<br>

            A group exhibition commissioned by Feminist Culture House
            and curated in collaboration with Gladys Camilo and Jonni Korhonen.
            The exhibition is imagined as a collectively construscted gardern for dreaming a utopia "now",
            showcasing works by four artists: Ignata Elana, Ama Essel, Aava Eronen, and Viljami Nissi.
            <em>Plantasy</em> seeks to provide a safe space for artists curators to play, dream, 
            and work together within a caring ecosystem.<br>
