            Solo Exhibition<br>
            The body of work combines quilts, paintings, sketches, and photographs with 
            memory, functioning as a focal point in my artistic methodology. The exhibition
            is a collection of experiences and feelings of belonging, and the 
            invisible aggressions of everyday life.<br>

                The mire is the mushy living soil that pulls me into dreams of terror
                and mangled faces; reality, turning inyo broken flesh and pleasures. It
                is the dense mud and wet softness that cradles and eats this weary body;
                sinking, in and out of place; confused, like, being ripped away from the
                roots, not knowing who you are and who you once were. Roots; decomposing bodies; 
                entangled and angry, cold and mucky. Floating into nothingness and into 
                everything. The mire, knows who it is but cannot remember who it was.
                Traversing treacherous landscapes without being seen, heard or found. Persisting, 
                in hopes of finding a space for rest beyond the mire."

            <b><em>Performing a Lifetime</em>, 2020</b><br>
            A book exploring bodies and identities belonging to the in-between.
            Saara Mahbouba and Gladys Camilo reflect on the complications of navigating
            between accurate representation of oneself and one’s community and the traps
            of performativity, appropriation, and self-exploitation.
            Exploring the complexities of working ethically in a contemporary artscene that
            simultaneously lauds and punishes otherness, Performing a Lifetime taps into the artists’
            personalexperiences of embodying identities that are neither fully within nor without categories
            of otherness and hegemonic bodies.<br>
